        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>My project will be an interactive desktop site that explores the wildlife and nature unique to Davis. The site will allow young members of the Davis community to be engaged with their natural surroundings and be more knowledgeable about the history of the city’s land. The distinct animals and plantlife will convey to them what makes their city special.</p>
        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <p>This site is meant to educate young students on specific animals and plants that are abundant in Davis. The information should be understandable to the target audience and written in a way that is engaging. The goal is to make the site simple and fun to use. It can be used as an educational device that not only teaches the users about specific animals and plants but also general information that will be helpful for teachers and parents to utilize.</p>
        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
        <p>The overall aesthetic of the site will mimic a children’s book. The design standards will communicate balance and embody the theme. The color palette will stay natural and light with shades of pale blue, browns, and greens, but will include many colors to grab the user's attention. I plan on using a typewriter font to stick to communicate a friendly and comforting vibe. The illustrations will be playful and blend with the visual hierarchy of the site.</p>
        <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
        <p>Through the site, users will be able to click on sticker-like illustrations of animals and plants that will then lead them to information about its history and relevance to the city. Each sticker will be presented as a character in a story. The characters won’t connect with one another but will help the target audience remember each element. With each informational page, users can click through pages to read more about each animal and plant.</p>
        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
        <p>Users should be learning educational material while having fun. They should be excited because the visual aesthetic will be enticing the users to interact with it. This will be achieved through the design standards, stylized illustrations, and simplicity of the interactions. After using this site, users will feel more in touch with their Davis community and know interesting facts about they plants and animals they see on a day-to-day basis.</p>
        <h2>Target Users</h2>
        <p>Children in the Davis community from the ages of 4 to 11, thus at an educational level of around the grades TK/Kindergarten to 5th grade.</p>

    <h1>User Journey Maps</h1>
    <h2>Version 1</h2>

    <p>For the first round of storyboarding, I had my user journey map tested by a fellow peer. After the testing, she expressed her confusion and provided some suggestions. Firstly, the wording of each step in my map could be improved upon by using more specific diction such as which part of the site the users will specifically be using. I also want to extend the journey by including more steps to provide more clarity. In the new version, I will better distinguish the characters so there is less confusion in the storyline. The tester also suggested including audio in my project through sound effects to appeal to my target audience which I plan to implement.</p>
    <h2>Version 2</h2>
    <img src="../../images/userjourney2.jpg" alt="userjourney2" width="600" class="uj">
    <p>For my improved storyboard, I included a more thorough and interesting storyline that allows testers to understand how my website will impact users and bring them closer to the Davis community. I improved the illustrations, added more steps, and used detailed descriptions, all of which improved the clarity and intent of my user journey map.</p>

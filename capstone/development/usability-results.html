    <h1>Usability Report</h1>
    <h2>Test Prompt</h2>
    <p>USER SCENARIO: “You’re a 3rd grade student living in Davis, CA learning about plants and animals in class. One day in class your teacher shares this website with you where you can learn about animals and plants in Davis. You open the site and see all the options available to you. You choose the cow which introduces you to new content. You can navigate back to the home page.”</p>
    <p>IN-PROGRESS WARNING: Other buttons besides the cow, are not currently clickable.</p>

    <h2>Post-test Questions and Answers</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>What do you think works well in terms of readability and visual design and what could be improved on?
            <ul>
                <li>I thought the readability and visual design looks and feels amazing. Something that could be improved could be to add a home button on the second slide of the cow page, giving users an easier way to return to the home screen. </li>
                <li>I thought the large and colorful designs on the animals work well to grab attention and are easily understandable for a 3rd grader. The home button could be improved by possibly making it large to stand out more.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>What was your favorite part of the site?
            <ul>
                <li>My favorite part of the site was the design of the buddies and buds, especially the tree.</li>
                <li>My favorite part of the site was the large cartoon animals that add well to the theme of the page.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>What other type of content about plants and animals would make the site more interesting?
            <ul>
                <li>Something that would make the site more interesting could be to add obscure fun facts about the plants and animals that not many people know about. </li>
                <li>I think some fun facts and interesting info on the plants and animals would make the site more interesting.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Observations</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The hover animations applied to the buttons encourage the users to complete the implied tasks. The subtle movement made the user flow easily understandable. This especially helped when there was a low color contrast between the background and the button. </li>
        <li>The hue of the yellow buttons on the information slides attracted the users, thus clearly indicating the next step of the user journey. At first, there was uncertainty on whether the highly saturated tone of the buttons would suit the theme, however, the user test proves that it not only supports the visual composition but also clearly signals the next steps for the users.</li>
        <li>The immediate physical and verbal reaction to the site’s design provided confidence in the visual appeal. The collaboration of the illustrations, color palette, and typography was enjoyed by the users and supported the overall playful child-friendly theme.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>Based on the usability test, I plan to keep the design standards as they are. The test proved that the visual appeal is working effectively and producing excitement and joy in the users. However, after the test, I decide to change the layout of the informational pages so users have more options. I will implement the home button on every page alongside a back button so users can flip through pages as well as access the home page at any time. The users' post-test responses also provided suggestions for the content of the information. I plan to implement a page solely for obscure fun facts about the animal/plant to add appeal and uniqueness to the information.</p>

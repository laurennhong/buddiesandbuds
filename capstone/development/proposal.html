    <p>I will individually work on making an interactive website where young children can learn about the wildlife and nature special to the city of Davis. The site will be colorful and playful, mimicking a children’s book. The home page will display sticker illustrations of different plants and animals that users will be able to click on to learn more information. I want to create characters for each of the creatures and flora and highlight why they are special to the city of Davis. Once you click on the expanded information I plan to include more illustrated graphics to make it appear like a story.</p>
    <p>The general idea and execution of my project do not seem difficult to implement, however, because of this I’m concerned about what I could do to make my project more exciting. One element I want to include in my project is animations. I believe this will add to the story-like theme and make the user experience more fun, however, I don’t have any experience in animation nor do I know which software to use. I am hoping that once I build the foundation of the site, I’ll be able to continuously add to it and implement more interesting features. </p>

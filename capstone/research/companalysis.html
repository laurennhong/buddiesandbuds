    <h1>Comparative Analysis</h1>
    <h2>Explore Prespa</h2>
    <a href="https://prespa.s.nomatter.dev/"><img src="images/prespa.png" alt="prespa" width="600"></a>
    <p>Explore Prespa is an interactive site that allows you to explore and learn about wildlife. It is similar to my topic and idea in both content and intention. The site is completely animated and utilizes a similar feature to the one I plan to use for my site. This site has excellent execution. I especially enjoyed that you were able to drag the screen and move around the ecosystem. I want to implement this aspect to my project.</p>

    <h2>MiniU</h2>
    <a href="https://www.miniu.co.uk/game/"><img src="images/miniu.png" alt="miniu" width="600"></a>
    <p>MiniU is a retail website, however, they also have a video game on their site. The aesthetic and child-like theme is similar to the design I plan to use for my site. The game was simple yet effective and fun. I really appreciated the illustrations and want to implement the same playful, rounded energy to my site.</p>

        <li>Ballou, Farrah. “A Guide to Davis' Spring Plants and Animals.” The Aggie, 6 Apr. 2021, https://theaggie.org/2021/04/06/a-guide-to-davis-spring-plants-and-animals/.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>This guide is a collection of information from professionals who have researched/are well-versed in the plant life and animals around Davis. This includes horticulture specialists and experts at the UC Davis Arboretum. This article provides me extensive knowledge directly given by individuals who study plants and animals for a living. I plan to use this information in my project to share interesting plant and animal facts with users and to promote UC Davis’s Arboretum. The article also mentions tips to locals and visitors on how to spot these plants and animals while they’re outside. Specifically, I want to include the flowers and birds mentioned in the article.</li>

        <li>Shelton, Susan. “Description of the Outer Ring of the Davis Centennial Seal.” Susan Shelton Ceramic Artist, 2021, https://susanshelton.com/Seals/Davis-Centennial-Seal/Description-of-the-Outer-Ring-of-the-Davis-Centennial-Seal.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Susan Shelton is the ceramic artist that oversaw the creative process of the Davis Centennial Seal. Shelton’s design process started with extensive research on the city’s history. On her website, she went in depth about her research on the community of Davis including the wildlife and nature native to the area. In this particular article, she explains how community individuals rebuilt the infamous Putah Creek which allowed indigenous plant and animal species to return to the area. This research is particularly important to my project because I will be incorporating two animals she speaks about - Steelhead Trout and Chinook Salmon. I will use her research on these animals to provide information to the users on the history of these animals and why they are important to Davis.

        <li>“Squirrels.” LocalWiki, 18 Mar. 2023, https://localwiki.org/davis/Squirrels.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Squirrels are one of the most iconic and abundant animals in Davis. This article provides all you need to know about the squirrels in Davis. They explain the specific breeds that reside in Davis, the areas where they are most populous, why they’re here, and how to identify them. There is also a comment section where local Davis members can share their opinions/complaints about Davis squirrels. In my project, there will be an emphasis on squirrels, because they are visibly the most frequently seen animals on campus and in Downtown. This article will allow me to share information about the multiple types of squirrels in the area and also help provide references for the illustrations I plan to include.
